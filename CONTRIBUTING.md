## Development Guidelines

### Versioning

This project follows open-source industry standard [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

**Version Format:** `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.2.3`)

**When to bump:**
- **MAJOR** (e.g., 1.0.0 → 2.0.0): Breaking changes that require users to update their code
  - Removing public methods, classes, or modules
  - Changing method signatures (parameters, return types)
  - Changing default behavior that breaks existing code
  - Dropping Python version support

- **MINOR** (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.1.0): New features that are backwards-compatible
  - Adding new public methods or classes
  - Adding optional parameters (with defaults)
  - New features that don't break existing code
  - Adding Python version support

- **PATCH** (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.0.1): Bug fixes that are backwards-compatible
  - Fixing bugs without changing the API
  - Documentation updates
  - Security fixes (non-breaking)
  - Internal refactoring

### Changelog

We maintain a [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format.

**For Contributors:** You don't need to update the changelog with your PRs. Maintainers will update it at release time.

**For Maintainers (Release Process):**

Before each release, review merged PRs and update the changelog with:

**What to include:**
- ✅ New features (→ **Added**)
- ✅ Changes to existing functionality (→ **Changed**)
- ✅ Soon-to-be removed features (→ **Deprecated**)
- ✅ Removed features (→ **Removed**)
- ✅ Bug fixes (→ **Fixed**)
- ✅ Security fixes (→ **Security**)
- ❌ Internal refactoring (unless it affects performance/behavior)
- ❌ Test-only changes
- ❌ CI/CD changes
- ❌ Documentation-only updates

**Process:**
1. Review all PRs merged since last release
2. Add user-facing changes to CHANGELOG.md under appropriate categories
3. Include PR numbers for reference (e.g., `(#123)`)
4. Focus on **why it matters to users**, not implementation details

**Adding version links to CHANGELOG.md:**

After creating tags, add version comparison links at the bottom of CHANGELOG.md:

```markdown
[0.1.0b3]: https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatform-DataverseClient-Python/compare/v0.1.0b2...v0.1.0b3
[0.1.0b2]: https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatform-DataverseClient-Python/compare/v0.1.0b1...v0.1.0b2
[0.1.0b1]: https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatform-DataverseClient-Python/releases/tag/v0.1.0b1
```

### Git Tags and Releases

We use git tags to mark release points and GitHub Releases for announcements.

**Creating Git Tags:**

Git tags should be created for every release published to PyPI:

```bash
# Create annotated tag for version X.Y.Z
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"

# Push tag to remote
git push origin --tags
```

**GitHub Releases:**

After publishing to PyPI, create a GitHub Release based on CHANGELOG.md

**Release notes format:**

```markdown
Brief summary of the release

### Added
- Feature 1 (#123)
- Feature 2 (#124)

### Fixed
- Bug fix 1 (#125)
- Bug fix 2 (#126)
```

**Post-Release Version Bump:**

After tagging and publishing a release, immediately bump the version on `main` to the next
development target. This ensures builds from source are clearly distinguished from the
published release:

```bash
# After publishing v0.1.0b4, bump to v0.1.0b5 on main
# Update version in pyproject.toml
# Commit directly to main: "Bump version to 0.1.0b5 for next development cycle"
```

### Docstring Type Annotations (Microsoft Learn Compatibility)

This SDK's API reference is published on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com). The Learn doc pipeline processes `:type:` and `:rtype:` Sphinx directives differently from standard Sphinx -- every word between `:class:` back-tick references is treated as a separate cross-reference (`<xref:word>`). For example:

```
:rtype: :class:`list` of :class:`str`
```

This produces a broken `<xref:of>` link because `of` is not a valid type.

**Rules for `:type:` and `:rtype:` directives:**

- Use **Python bracket notation** for generic types: `list[str]`, `dict[str, typing.Any]`, `list[dict]`
- Use **`or`** (without `:class:`) for union types: `str or None`, `dict or list[dict]`
- Use **bracket nesting** for complex types: `collections.abc.Iterable[list[dict]]`
- `:class:` is fine for **single standalone types**: `` :class:`str` ``, `` :class:`bool` ``

**NEVER** use the following patterns -- the connector words (`of`, `mapping`, `to`) become broken `<xref:>` links on Learn:

```
:class:`X` of :class:`Y`
:class:`X` mapping :class:`Y` to :class:`Z`
```

Correct:
```
:type data: dict or list[dict]
:rtype: list[str]
:type select: list[str] or None
```

Wrong:
```
:type data: :class:`dict` or :class:`list` of :class:`dict`
:rtype: :class:`list` of :class:`str`
```
